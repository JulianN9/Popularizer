How to run:
1. Install a g++ compiler, probably mingw32/mingw64. Google those names if you don't understand that.
2. In a terminal go to the folder containing these file and input the following inside the quotation marks:
"g++ -0 popularizer.exe popularizer.cpp Dpops.cpp"
3. Run the resulting popularizer.exe file, following the instructions as prompted

If you don't know how to use a command prompt than I recommend doing this all in VSCode, and following this guide to get a compiler going (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
